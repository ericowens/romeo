    <h1>The Future is Now</h1>
    <p>For far too long, we’ve taken from nature without replenishing. Now,
here we are. We see and feel the effects and it’s time for change. It’s
      time for generational change.</p>
<p>At Romeo Power, we’re not just in the business of delivering
electrification solutions for complex commercial applications. We want
to change the way people live. We have a bold vision to create a world
where energy poverty no longer exists. And perhaps more importantly,
  we have an innate sense of curiosity to help us make it happen.</p>
<p>Curiosity is our key to survival. It’s the thing that spurs innovation. It
empowers us to find new ways to approach seemingly unyielding
challenges. We embrace the tough questions because they
  ’re necessary to spark transformation. We have an opportunity to make universal
  energy a thing of the future.</p>
<p>And the future is now.</p>
